Stay with me as long as you love me

You're the one I need to live

Be my girl as long as you want me

Your kiss is sweet, give me a lift

 

Everything I know is that I want to live with you

No matter, babe, what happened in the past

Just take a look at me and I'm sure that you will see

I don't want to give you up 'cause you're the best

 

Our love, it shines, shines like the sun

Sometimes more and sometimes less

Love is strange in some of the changing (?)

But I don't want to live without your caress

You're everything to me and I want you to feel special

I'll never find another one like you

When you broke into my world, I knew that belonged together

I'm sure you know it too: our love is true
