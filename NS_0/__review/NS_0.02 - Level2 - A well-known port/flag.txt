Level 3 - A well-known port

This picture represents the network layout of the running containers. HOST represents the hosting machine (i.e., the machine running Docker).

Node1 is connected to the HOST node using the private network 192.168.168.0/24.

On each node, a network service is running. It is listening for connections on its own well-known port.

Try to identify the service and use the corresponding client for connecting to this service on node1 from the HOST node.

Remember that the root password is ccit.

    Run docker ps to list the running containers.

    Run docker network inspect <node1_id> to look at the network details.

    We can see that the ip is 192.168.123.123. Now we need to find the port.

    Let's run ss -tuln inside the container. We can see that the port is 22 which is a well-known port for ssh.

    Now we can connect to the service using ssh root@192.168.123.123 and enter the password ccit.
