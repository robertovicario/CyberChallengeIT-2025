Level 4 - 3-way handshake

The ip command is one of the Linux tools for administering the network configuration.

In particular, you can assing an address to an interface using the following syntax:

ip addr add [ipaddress/netmask] dev [devicename] (for removing an existing address ip addr del [ipaddress/netmask] dev [devicename])

For example, you can add to eth0 the address 192.168.100.100 from the 192.168.100.0/24 network using:

ip addr add 192.168.100.100/24 dev eth0

Use this command for configuring the connection between node1 and node2 according to this updated network layout.

After you complete the above task, execute a 3-way handshake from node1 to node2 using the custom script level4 on node1.

    We need to configure the network interfaces of node1 and node2 according to the picture network layout. We can do this by running the following commands respectively on node1 and node2:

    ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth1

    ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev eth0

Now we can simply run level4 on node1 to execute the 3-way handshake.

Flag: CCIT{level4_[ephemeralport]_[destinationport]_[clientstartsequencenumber]} which is CCIT{level4_2799_22_2254}
