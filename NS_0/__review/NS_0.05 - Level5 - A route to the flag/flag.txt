Level 5 - A route to the flag

The ip command allows adding static routes.

In particular, you can update the routing table of a node and add a static route to a remote network using the following syntax:

ip route add [remotenet_ipaddress/netmask] via [nexthop_ipaddress]

Notice that the nexthop_ipaddress is the IP address of the node to which the packet should be forwarded for reaching the remote network.

Add a route to node2 so that it can reach the address 192.168.123.123. Test your configuration executing the custom script level5.

    [nexthop_ipaddress] for node2 is 10.0.0.2. So simply enter the command ip route add 192.168.123.0/24 via 10.0.0.2 in it.
